# Kotlin and Spring Workshop 
## November 2022

This repo contains the materials for the internal Kotlin and Spring workshop, delivered by Garth Gilmour and Andrew Paul on 7/8 November 2022.

The contents are:

* `kotlin` - the projects from the Instil Kotlin course
* `spring` - selected projects from the Instil Spring courses
* `manuals` - the regular course manuals from the Kotlin and Spring deliveries

Note that these materials (along with those for all our standard deliveries) are always available to you on GitHub and GDrive.

All the projects should work in IntelliJ, with JDK 11 or above installed. Note that the most recent JDK (19 at time of writing) may introduce compatability issues.
